# Laborbuch - To improve (micro)-SAM's automatic segmentation
by producing heftier prompts

## Blob detection
- with https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html
- inverted image to meet funs requirements
  - increased snesitivity of LOG
  - not much since it's phase contrast where cell boundaries are mostly contrast rich
---
- quite promising as some initial prompt
- by visual inspection issues with large cells aswell
