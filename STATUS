discuss cellnet with dima
- cellnet
  - apply blob detection to output
  - or threshholding
  - also check out deconvolution
  - improve target heatmap: close gaussians should repell each other
  - improve loss: maybe cross entropy? try focal as in centernet   (aim: while the exact position is relaively wain each cell (-centerpoint) should get exactly one blob)
    - subpress faulty detections, like dirt?
    - enhance repelling of neighbouring gaussian
    - maybe try other than gaussian
    - evaluation metric could be avarage distance between target and prediction objects in optimal matching
      - also account for difference in number of detected objects


- compound task: border information - like in original unet paper



- THesis: redraw timeline 
 -> problems solutions patterns to be seen from this 


- say stuart that Im focusing on thesis writing
- ask for more points 
- compare with their counts to estimate healthy error boundaries  (model vs human vs current approach)
  - maybe model is near to human but far from their current approach


- counts counts counts  








- replace Sten's model with Kaupo's formula



--- ideas 

- incomplete annotatios: bg recalib loss from denys's thesis


- pretraining data: cycleGAN to translate between livecell and sanger datasets


--- notes 

- cell clusters have higher density, therefore area based method instable and better to segment individual cells (area as baseline)
