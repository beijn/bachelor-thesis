## Localizing Cells in Phase-Contrast Microscopy Images using Sparse and Noisy Center-Point Annotations

This is the code of my Bachelor's thesis I am currently writing in the Biomedical Computer Vision Lab at _University of Tartu_ and the Computational Cell Analytics group at _University of GÃ¶ttingen_ for a human genome study at _Wellcome Sanger Institute_ in Cambridge.
The goal of this work is to localize and count the living cells in low-quality phase-contrast images using only sparse and noisy center-point annotations.

Notebooks with results of the experiments together with their code are under `runs`. The most promising approach is [./runs/smp/unet-heatmap/231211-124400-005627.ipynb](https://github.com/beijn/bachelor-thesis/blob/main/runs/smp/unet-heatmap/231211-124400-005627.ipynb).
